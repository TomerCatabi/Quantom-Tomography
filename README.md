# Quantom-Tomography
This repository consists of a TAU lab C expiriment code created by students in order to process the data that was collected in the lab.
Please note that repository has three different brunches other than the one you are currently on, those are the three brunches with the expirment related code. Each brunch corrisponds to each part of the expiriment. 
In addition, please note that the code used to extract the data from the videos is the one recived in the lab (with some modifications) and the data was extracted menually from the matlab code editor's work place section. The format of the CSV files read by python is specidied in the readme file for each of the brunches relvant (i.e parts 1 and 3).
